# folder_city

a city made entirely of folders and files. start in the welcome center and navigate by opening folders. explore to find more locations, like the library (one block to the east), and create your own locations by creating new folders and files.

for now, you need to install python (?) and then run the FolderCity.py file. the welcome center folder will be created in the same directory as the python file. at some point in the unknowable future this will hopefully be a little app so you won't need to do anything except open it. but idk how to do that yet, and there's still a lot to build in the city.
